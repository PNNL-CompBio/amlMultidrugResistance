# Patient sample drug response
This project collects patient samples before treatment with venetoclax + azacytidine and attempts to stratify the patients by response to therapy.

## Experiment 28 Data
The data for this project can be found on Synapse under the [Experiment 28 directory](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn68733653). 
This folder contains the metadata as well as protein measurements for the patient samples.

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is two fold: first to identify any biomarkers that predict drug response in patient samples, and second to validate 
biomarkers from other model systems.
