# Lipid batch correction

Here we combine two datasets to create a single lipidomic measurement dataset
for the manuscript

## Starting files
We require specific files for the analysis, documented below.

### Metadata
To combine the two cohorts we use the metadata file assembled for this purpose.
The metadata is found [here](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn69692583). 

### Beat AML lipid analysis

Beat AML lipid data can be found [on synapse](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn52121001)
for processing. 

### Black patient lipid analysis

The black patient files can be found
[in the lipids folder](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn71210014) of the
Experiment 26 directory.
