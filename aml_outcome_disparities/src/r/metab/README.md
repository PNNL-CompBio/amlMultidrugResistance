# Metabolite batch correction

Here we combine two datasets to create a single metabolomic measurement dataset
for the manuscript.

## Starting files
We require specific files for the analysis, documented below.

### Metadata
To combine the two cohorts we use the metadata file assembled for this purpose.
The metadata is found [here](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn69692583). 

### Beat AML metabolite analysis

Beat AML metabolite data can be found [on synapse](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn53678273)
for processing. 

### Black patient metabolite analysis

The black patient files can be found *** WHERE??*** of the
Experiment 26 directory. 

*** Javi please specific initial files to start with ***

## Batch correction steps

*** Javi what order do I run the scripts in? ***


## Final combined data

*** Javi what file is the combined metabolomics data? ***
