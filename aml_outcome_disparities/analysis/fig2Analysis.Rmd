The goal of this analysis is to look at differences across patients with 
various mutational profiles to identify specific pathways altered in 
mutational phenotypes.

# Mutational profile (clinical)

The first chunk of analysis comes from the clinical sequencing information, 
which we have pulled below. 

```{r mut data}

mut_data <- readr::read_csv(synapser::synGet('syn69692583'))

##while we're at it, pull other data sources

```

## Diffex proteins


```{r diffex proteins, echo=FALSE}

```

## Diffex transcripts

## Diffex metabolites

## Diffex lipids

## Diffex acetyl sites

## Common analysis? 

# Repeat with WES data?
