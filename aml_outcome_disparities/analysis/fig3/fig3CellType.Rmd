The goal of this analysis is to align the samples to the monocytic/GMP/primitive
axis and compare the populations of those patients with each phenotype
and determine if there are any difference in markers.

# Van Galen Signature makers

The first cell type markers we will use are from the van galen dataset.
We will pull the Xcell scores for these first.


```{r vg signatures}


```

How are the patients distributed across cohorts/race? 

## Differentially expressed proteins


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```
