# Analysis folder
This folder will contain the high level analyses/questions to compare to 
ask specific questions of the data. 

## Batch correction
I want to see, across all omes, that the two batches can be combined without
issue. 

## Mutational analysis
The first question we want to ask is what molecules and pathways are 
differentially expressed between patients with a specific moelcular marker:
1- NRAS mutation
2- FLT3-ITD
3- TP53
4- NPM1

How do the molecules/pathways change between those that are differentially
expressed only in black patients, white patients compared to all patients? 

## Cell type analysis

The second question leverages the RNAseq-based deconvolution and asks what
molecules are differentially expressed between monocytic tumors, primitive 
tumors, and GMP-like tumors.
