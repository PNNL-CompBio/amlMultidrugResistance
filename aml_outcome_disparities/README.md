# Patient outcome disparities in AML

This work focuses on understanding why black patients with AML fare worse than white patients with the same 
molecular profiles. Much of this work is premised on a publication and samples from [Stiff et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01929-x). 

## Experiment 26 Data
From the ~100 or so patient samples we measured:
- proteomics
- phosphoproteomics
- metabolomics
- lipidomics
- acetylomics
That data is all stored in the [Experiment 26 directory](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn62750464) on Synapse and currently under embargo. 
Additionally we plan to integrate data from the Stiff et al paper above.

## Project goals
The goal of this project is to understand why known biomarkers of AML prognosis fail to predict response in black patients.
