# AML Multidrug resistance studies
This repository contains the analysis and processing for multiple projects focusing on multidrug resistance for the CPTAC funded OHSU/PNNL PTRC. 

## Basic data processing
We focus on three drugs :gilteritinib (gilt), decitabine (dec), and venetoclax (ven).  We used single resistance models of gilt and dec, plus dual resistance models of gilt/ven, gilt/dec, and finally gilt/ven/dec. Enrichment analysis was performed with enrichR through MAGINE.
