# Drug treated patient samples
This analysis focuses on an ex vivo system for measuring long term expression changes of patient samples upon drug treatment. 

## Experiment 25 Data
The data for this analysis is primarily found in the [Experiment 25](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn59555062) directory on synapse. 
The data is currently under embargo until we publish.  

## Ongoing analysis
The primary goal of this project is to develop a protein signature that can predict resistance to venetoclax with a hypomethylating agent such as
decitabine or azacytidine.
