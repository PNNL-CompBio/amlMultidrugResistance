Here we'll create some small summary statistics of the new clinical samples.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(synapser)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

```

## Grab and parse metadata
Metadata is currently on synapse in an excel file under syn68733653. 


```{r cars}
synLogin()

mfile <- readxl::read_xlsx(synapser::synGet('syn69058992')$path)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
